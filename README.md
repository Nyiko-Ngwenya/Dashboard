The webscraping spider is called movies 

It is located within the IMDB/IMDB/spiders/movies.py

The website i scrapped was "https://www.imdb.com/search/title/?genres=comedy&genres=Romance&explore=title_type,genres&ref_=adv_explore_rhs"

I scrapped all the results and cleaned the data as i only noticed that its movies and TV series . 

The notebook i used to read and clean the data is IMDB/IMDB.ipynb
